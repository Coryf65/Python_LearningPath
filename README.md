Learning Python for fun !

## Algorithm Overview

- Complexity 

    - Space complexity: How much memeory does it require?

    - Time Complexity: How much time does it take to complete?

- Inputs and Outputs

    - What does the algorithm accept, and what are the results?

- Classification

    - Serial / Parallel, exact / approximate,
        deterministic / non-deterministic

-Common Algorithms

    - Searching

    - Sorting

    - Computational (take data and derive another)

    - Collection (filtering out data, counting)

- Performance

    - Big-O notation

*a good amount, not an exhaustive list*
| Notation  | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| 0(1)  | Constant time  |  Looking up a single element in an array  |
| 0(log n)  | Logarithmic  |  Finding an item in a sorted array with a binary search  |
| 0(n)  | Linear time  |  Searching an unsorted array for a specific value  |
| 0(n log n)  | Log-linear |  Complex sorting algorithms like heap sort and merge sort  |
| 0(n^2)  | Quadratic  |  Simple sorting alorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort  |


## Data Structures

Used to organize data so it can be processed

- Common Data Structures

    - Arrays
    - Linked lists 
    - Stacks and queues
    - Trees
    - Hash tables

- Arrays :

a collection of elements identified by an index or key

Can be Multi-Demensional Arrays

- Array Operations

    - Calculate item index: O(1)
    - Insert or delete item at beginning: O(n)
    - Insert or delete item at middle: O(n)
    - Insert or delete item at end: O(1)
