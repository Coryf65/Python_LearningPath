1. Algorithm Overview

- Complexity 

    - Space complexity: How much memeory does it require?

    - Time Complexity: How much time does it take to complete?

- Inputs and Outputs

    - What does the algorithm accept, and what are the results?

- Classification

    - Serial / Parallel, exact / approximate,
        deterministic / non-deterministic

2. Common Algorithms

    - Searching

    - Sorting

    - Computational (take data and derive another)

    - Collection (filtering out data, counting)

3. Performance

    - Big-O notation

*a good amount, not an exhaustive list*
| Notation  | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| 0(1)  | Constant time  |  Looking up a single element in an array  |
| 0(log n)  | Logarithmic  |  Finding an item in a sorted array with a binary search  |
| 0(n)  | Linear time  |  Searching an unsorted array for a specific value  |
| 0(n log n)  | Log-linear |  Complex sorting algorithms like heap sort and merge sort  |
| 0(n^2)  | Quadratic  |  Simple sorting alorithms, such as bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort  |
